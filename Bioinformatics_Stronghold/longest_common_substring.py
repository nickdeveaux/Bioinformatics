Created by Nick DeVeaux on 2014-08-07.

Problem:

A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection.
 We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer 
 common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGGTATA",
  but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "GTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" 
are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any 
	single solution.)
